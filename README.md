### Training project
This application is a training project for android development cources in Java and is published here to provide at least some idea of my coding experience.
Please note, that it is not completed yet and requires a lot of refactoring.
The project is written in Java in MVP-architecture (sort of), using such libraries as Retrofit, Dagger 2, Moxy, Picasso and PayPal.
